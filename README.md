# Data-Analytics-with-Python-Capstone-Project
The bustling city of New York witnesses a continual surge in its culinary landscape, with an increasing number of restaurants catering to the needs of students and busy professionals. Amidst their hectic lifestyles, online food delivery services emerge as a convenient solution, bridging the gap between consumers and their favorite eateries. FoodHub, a pioneering food aggregator, streamlines this process by offering a comprehensive selection of restaurants through a user-friendly smartphone app.
Empowering restaurants with direct online ordering capabilities, the FoodHub app orchestrates a seamless transaction process. Upon confirmation of an order, the app swiftly assigns a dedicated delivery person to collect the package from the restaurant. Navigating through the city using advanced mapping technology, the delivery person awaits the food package and subsequently embarks on the journey to the customer's location. With the package securely in hand, the delivery person confirms the pick-up within the app before proceeding to fulfill the final leg of the delivery.
Upon reaching the customer's doorstep, the delivery person completes the transaction by confirming the drop-off within the app interface. Customers, in turn, have the opportunity to rate their order, providing valuable feedback for both restaurants and the aggregator. FoodHub sustains its operations by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order value from partnering restaurants.
In essence, FoodHub revolutionizes the food delivery experience, offering unparalleled convenience and efficiency while fostering a thriving ecosystem of culinary delights in the bustling metropolis of New York.

The objective of this project is to analyze the data  to find answers to Foohub questions to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience.
